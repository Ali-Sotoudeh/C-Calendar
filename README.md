This code works based on Persian Calendar.
It has 3 main options : Calendar, Age, and Conversion.
It can print out the days in a certain month & year in 1st section.
It calculates your age by getting the input in Persian calendar in 2nd section.
It also converts Persian dates to Christian dates and vice versa in the last part.


Any suggestions are appreciated!
